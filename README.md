# QuickQueue-AI-Enhanced-Smart-Queue-Management-System

# About the Project
QuickQueue is a queue management system I built to make waiting lines more efficient and user-friendly. Instead of people standing in long, uncertain queues, the system predicts wait times using machine learning and organizes tokens with a priority-based approach.

It also comes with a simple web portal where users can book slots, track their position in real time, and admins can monitor the entire queue flow through a dashboard.

# Tech Used
Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: MySQL
Machine Learning: Python (XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn)
Testing: Postman, Selenium

# What It Can Do
Predicts expected wait times using ML models
Assigns tokens with a priority system for fair service
Lets users book slots online and check live status
Provides an admin dashboard for monitoring queues
Supports QR-based check-in/out to ensure accuracy

# How It Works
A user books a slot online.
The system predicts the wait time using the ML model.
Tokens are managed with a priority queue to avoid delays.
The admin dashboard shows queue status and insights.
QR check-in ensures timestamps are accurate.
